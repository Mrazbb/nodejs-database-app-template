## Nodejs Database App Template

This example can be viewed on https://nodejs-database-app-template.marek-mraz.com/


Template for building a nodejs application with a PostgreSQL database.
This template can be used as a starting point for building a new application in Total.js or any other nodejs framework. 

Database is managed with my library pg-altergen, that I created for easy management of database versioning and migrations. In folder app/sql you can find sql scripts for creating database, schemas, views, functions, triggers, and also basic data for initial setup.

In this example in folder app/sql/10_insert are data about movies for this example. 


Project is build with Total.js framework.
